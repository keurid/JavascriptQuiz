# JavascriptQuiz

## Description

My motivation with this project was to build a quiz using javascript was to better understand JavaScript and how to properly use CSS to help hide elements that are not necessary to be seen.
I learned about JavaScript and leared about CSS in a deeper more complex way that helped me challenge my way of thinking when coding.
